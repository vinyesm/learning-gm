DREAM5 community networks
=========================

Community networks for E. coli, S. aureus, S. cerevisiae, and the in silico compendium, obtained by integrating the predictions of all 29 submissions of the DREAM5 network inference challenge.

Format
------

1st column: TF
2nd column: target gene
3rd column: average rank assigned to this interaction across the 29 team submissions
4th column: estimated precision at this cutoff in the list (see below)

Precision
---------

Precision (fraction of true positives at the given cutoff in the list) was computed as described in the Online Methods and Supplementary Note 4 (note that TFs and genes that are not part of the gold standard, i.e., for which no experimentally supported interactions exist, were ignored when computing the precision).

The precision was not evaluated for S. aureus because few experimentally supported interactions exist.
