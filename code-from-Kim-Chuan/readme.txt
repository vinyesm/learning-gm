This code was provided by Professor Kim-Chuan Toh to solve the convex program in the paper:

"Latent Variable Graphical Model Selection via Convex Optimization" by Venkat Chandrasekaran, Pablo A. Parrilo, and Alan S. Willsky.

Here is the correspondence between the parameters in the code and those in the paper:

1) rho = lambda*gamma

2) beta = lambda

3) S = X1 + X2

4) L = X2

Please also remember to change the path to the LogDetPPA solver.
