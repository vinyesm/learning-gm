\section{Identifiability}
\label{sec:id}
Let  $M^{\ast}$ be a matrix that writes as  $M^{\ast}= S^{\ast}-L^{\ast}$, with $S^{\ast}$ an unknown sparse matrix and an unknown  low $k,\succeq$-rank matrix, that writes  $L^{\ast}=\sum_{I\in\mathcal{I}L^{I}}$. We want to know, given $M^{\ast}$, ther exist a unique decomposition $\left(S,(L^{I})_{I\in\mathcal{I}}\right)$ satisfying this conditions. More formally we want to know under which conditions the following optimization problem 
\begin{align}
\min \gamma\|S\|_1+\Omega_{k,\succeq}(L) \quad s.t. \quad M=S+L
\end{align}
has a unique solution.\\
In order to characterize when a unique decomposition is possible we introduce a notion of incoherence between the subspaces containing the different components. Following ideas from \citet{chandrasekaran2011rank}, we extend identifiability conditions for our setting and show that  our assumptions yields results that are different than the one obtained in \citet{chandrasekaran2011rank}. We consider the case where the sets $I\in\mathcal{I}$ do not overlap.
