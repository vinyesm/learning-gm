\subsection{Synthetic data}

We consider three differents latent-variable Gaussian graphical models.

The first model consists of $p=90$ observed variables and $h=3$ latent variables, we split observed variables in three groups of size $30$ and connect each group to a single latent variable. The second model is formed by $p=30+15+5=50$ observed variables and $h=3$ latents variables we split observed variables in three groups of different sizes ($30,15$ and $5$) and connect each group to a single latent variable. The third model consists of $p=$ observed variables and $h=5$, we select $5$ overlapping groups of observed variables, with an overlap of $ $, and connect each one of them to a different latent variable.

For all three models the conditional graphical model structure of the observed variables is a tree with the edge partial correlation coefficients equal to 0.25.
