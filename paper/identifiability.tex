\section{Identifiability}
\label{sec:id}

Following ideas from \citet{chandrasekaran2011rank}


Some kind of incoherence is necessary between the spaces.

More precisely we want to know under which conditions on ..., for a given matrix $X$, the following problem 
\begin{align}
\min \mu\|Y\|_1+\lambda\Omega_{k,\succeq}(Z) \quad s.t. \quad X=Y+Z
\end{align}
has a unique solution.

\begin{thm} Assume existence, then unicity
\end{thm}

\begin{thm} Existance, for the case of disjoint blocs 
\end{thm}
